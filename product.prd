## Product Name: **Bozo Game Groups**

## Author: Michael Allen

## Date: *\[May 2025]*

---

## 1. 📌 Objective

Enable users to create and join private or public betting groups that engage in a cyclical parlay-based game called the **Bozo Game**, where each member contributes a pick, and failed group parlays result in a humorous penalty and responsibility system.

---

## 2. 📈 Goals & Success Metrics

### 🎯 Primary Goals

* Allow users to join/create groups with recurring betting cycles.
* Each group member contributes one pick to a **group parlay**.
* After a failed parlay, members vote to assign the title of “Bozo” to the most egregious pick contributor.
* Bozo becomes responsible for placing the next parlay.

### ✅ Success Metrics

* % of users who create or join at least one group.
* % of cycles completed (all picks submitted).
* Avg. engagement in group chat.
* % of successfully submitted parlays.
* Bozo voting participation rate.

## 7. 🔄 Flow: Bozo Game Lifecycle

1. **Cycle starts**
2. Members make picks
3. Odds confirmed
4. Bozo places parlay
5. Parlay fails → vote on Bozo
6. New Bozo selected → next cycle starts

---

## 8. 🔧 MVP Considerations

* Skip in-app parlay placement → link to sportsbook
* Manual payout handling with reminders only (no actual transactions)
* Focus on 1–2 major sportsbooks for links
* Max group size: 10–20 for simplicity
* No group discovery/search in MVP

---

## 9. ⚙️ Technical Considerations

* Use polling or WebSockets for real-time updates (chat, odds)
* Scheduled Lambda to end/start cycles
* Integrate with a sports data API (e.g., TheOddsAPI, Betfair) for live odds
* Use DynamoDB TTL for expiring old cycles and votes

---

## 10. 🛠 Future Enhancements

* Multi-parlay group formats
* Reputation/ranking system for Bozos
* Web version of group interface
* NFT or digital badge for the Bozo
* Stats dashboard for each group
